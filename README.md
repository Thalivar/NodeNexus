# 🌲 NodeNexus

**NodeNexus** is a learning-focused C++ project that explores the core concepts and mechanics behind **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** and **AVL Trees**.
It features basic implementations of both structures, including insertion, deletion, and search operations — with simple ASCII visualizations to illustrate how nodes are organized.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Learn and demonstrate how Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees work
- Understand the difference between unbalanced and self-balancing trees
- Practice implementing tree structures and recursive algorithms in C++
- Visualize tree structures using clean ASCII diagrams

---

## ⚙️ Features

### ✅ Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Node insertion
- Node deletion
- Search functionality
- In-order, pre-order, post-order traversal
- ASCII visualization of the tree

### ✅ AVL Tree
- Self-balancing rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)
- Height and balance factor tracking
- All basic operations (insert, delete, search)
- ASCII tree display for structure comparison
